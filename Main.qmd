## Abstract (268/200 words)

Grazing, warmer climate, and atmospheric nitrogen deposition are global change drivers impacting alpine environments.
They occur simultaneously, and interact and impact biodiversity through the same underlying mechanism: change in productivity and biomass.
Indirect effects of warming and nitrogen addition (competition) generally have negative impacts on biodiversity, while effects of change in grazing depends on grazing intensity and plant productivity.
Grazing occurs locally and at shorter time scales, and can therefore be more easily manipulated.
Grazing can benefit diversity when it leads to competitive release and therefore has the potential to mitigate negative impacts of warming and nitrogen addition.
We studied the single and interactive effects of these three drivers on alpine diversity and under which conditions grazing is beneficial for diversity.
For this, we manipulated warmer climate (transplant to lower elevation), nitrogen deposition (fertilizer) and grazing (clipping and removal of biomass) along an elevational gradient (alpine and sub-alpine site) and assessed change in vascular plant composition and diversity over three years.

At the alpine site, warming in combination with increased nitrogen decreases diversity, but simulated grazing can mitigate this, especially at nitrogen addition above 10 kg N ha^-1^ y^-1^.
However, at the sub-alpine site, nitrogen addition was the main driver for decrease in diversity.
The change in diversity was mainly driven by increased productivity and abundance of graminoids and a decrease of forbs.
The changes in community composition were mainly driven by changes in evenness (abundance) in the alpine, and decreasing species richness in the sub-alpine.
This study shows that grazing can mediate negative impacts of warming and nitrogen addition, and thus will be an important ecosystem management tool under future climate conditions.

## Main (3500 words)

Global change is a major threat to biodiversity and is driven by multiple anthropogenic pressures such as land-use change, explotation, climate change and pollution [@Ipbes2019-sd; @rillig2019role; @jaureguiberry2022direct].
These drivers do not act in isolation, they occur simultaneously and interact.
Different global change drivers often affect the same abiotic (e.g. environmental filtering) and biotic (e.g. competition) processes that influence community composition and diversity [@grime1973competitive; @hobbs2009novel].
Global change studies however often include few drivers and not always investigate interactions which is problematic because they can underestimate the impact and make predicting global change impacts challenging [@Komatsu2019-yr; @rillig2019role; @oliver2014interactions].
To improve our understand of global change impacts on biodiversity, we need studies that manipulate multiple global change drivers and can disentangle single and combined effects.

Mountains support livelihoods for hundreds of millions, by providing biodiversity, and important ecosystem functions and services such as clean water, carbon sequestration, and grazing pastures [@egan2017mountain].
Alpine grasslands are temperature limited, have low nutrient availability and have been managed for grazing and fodder production within socio-ecological systems of transhumance or mixed agriculture for centuries [@Austrheim2001-nu; @Bunce2004-kn].
During the last decades, mountains have warmed faster than the average [@Ipcc2022-jw; @pepin2015elevation] and climate change impacts in alpine habitats have been studied extensively [@verrall2020alpine; @harte1995shifting; @inouye2020effects].
At the same time mountains are affected by other drivers such as atmospheric nitrogen deposition and change in grazing regimes [@Humbert2016-wg; @Austrheim2001-nu; @macdonald2000agricultural].
These three drivers occur simultaneously, they interact and impact alpine plant communities and diversity through the same underlying mechanisms: change in productivity and aboveground standing biomass (@fig-concept a).

Warmer climate and nitrogen deposition both positively affect plant productivity, leading to more standing biomass and potentially a positive feedback to plant productivity (@fig-concept a) [@fu2015meta; @rustad2001meta; @Humbert2016-wg].
The relationship between standing biomass and plant diversity is non-linear and generally highest at low to intermediate biomass (@fig-concept b).
Colder and nutrient-poor grasslands, characterised by facilitative species interactions [@bertness1994positive; @choler2001facilitation], often support low-productiv plant communities with little standing biomass, but are relatively species rich (peak in @fig-concept b)[@milchunas1993quantitative; @grime1973competitive].
In contrast, warmer and productive grasslands have more standing biomass and usually favour few dominant and more competitive species, leading to a decrease in diversity (right side in @fig-concept b)[@grime1973competitive].
Warming and nitrogen addition can increase diversity in a cold and low productive grassland, however in more productive systems, they often lead to diversity loss (grey area in @fig-concept b) [@Humbert2016-wg; @steinbauer2018accelerated].
Combined effects of warming and nitrogen addition decrease diversity and are often additive [@yue2020changes; @Klanderud2005-yx].

Grazers impact plant communities through the same mechanisms, but in a more complex way.
They remove biomass and can stimulate plant productivity via nutrient addition such as urin and/or dung (@fig-concept a).
<!-- Plants can compensate the loss of biomass with compensatory growth if grazing intensity is moderate (McNaughton 1983). -->
The net effect of grazing on plant diversity can thus be positive or negative and depends on grazing intensity, grazing history, and environmental context (e.g. moisture, temperature and/or nutrients) [@milchunas1988generalized; @milchunas1993quantitative; @cingolani2005grazing].
In low productive systems where facilitative interactions are common, grazing will likely have a negative impact on diversity.
However, in productive systems, the removal of biomass can release competition and increase diversity (grey area in @fig-concept b and c) [@Austrheim2001-nu; @Bernes2015-yg].
In addition, grazing is often managed locally and at short time scales and is suitable as an ecosystem management tool.
Grazing has therefore the potential to mitigate the negative impacts of warming and nitrogen addition on alpine diversity.
There are numerous global change studies in alpine grasslands, but surprisingly few studies have manipulated multiple global change drivers [but see @Zhu2015-jw].

The aim of this study is to disentangle the single and combined effects of warmer climate, nitrogen addition and grazing on plant productivity and diversity in alpine grasslands.
In addition, we test if grazing can mediate negative impacts of warming and nitrogen addition on diversity.
We used a fully factorial and replicated field experiment at an alpine and a sub-alpine site in Western Norway, representing different annual and summer temperature as well as plant productivity.
Alpine plant communities were exposed to a combination of warmer climate (transplant to lower elevation), increased nitrogen deposition (ranging between 0 and 150 kg N ha^-1^ y^-1^), and simulated grazing by clipping and removing biomass at two different intensities (@fig-concept d).
Plant communities moved to lower elevation experienced an approximately 3°C higher average summer temperature (air: `r summer_T$diff[1]` ± `r summer_T$se_diff[1]` °C, ground: `r summer_T$diff[2]` ± `r summer_T$se_diff[2]` °C, and soil: `r summer_T$diff[3]` ± `r summer_T$se_diff[3]` °C; Supplement @fig-daily-climate).
<!-- a bit unsure if the N deposition is correct -->
We chose a large range of nitrogen levels to simulate nitrogen addition close to and well beyond the atmospheric nitrogen deposition in the mountains in southern Norway (2-3 kg N ha^−1^ yr^−1^) [@aas2023monitoring] and the critical load for change in species composition in alpine grasslands (c. 5-10 kg N ha^−1^ yr^−1^) [@bobbink2011review].
We simulated grazing by clipping because our main interest was in the effect of biomass removal, however, we also had naturally grazed plots outside the fenced area to account for the difference of grazing by animals and clipping.
After three years of treatment, annual plant productivity was estimated by harvesting standing biomass and the change in vascular plant species composition and diversity was assessed.
We hypothesised that warming and nitrogen addition increase annual aboveground plant productivity and decrease vascular plant diversity, by favouring competitive graminoids [@grime1973competitive; @Klanderud2005-yx].
We also expect stronger responses to warming and nitrogen addition at the alpine compared to the sub-alpine site, because it is more temperature and nutrient limited.
Finally, we expected grazing to reduce standing biomass and avoid of species loss, especially in the sub-alpine site, where competitive release might be more important than facilitation.


## Results

### Annual productivity and functional group cover

The most parsimonious model for annual productivity and sedge cover was the quadratic model, and for all other functional group cover the logarithmic model.

Annual productivity decreased with elevation and was almost six times lower in the alpine compared to the sub-alpine site (@fig-prod-cover a).
At the alpine site, annual productivity increased five times with warming and even more in combination with nitrogen addition (@tbl-prod).
Productivity was highest at 100 kg N m^-2^ y^-1^, but decreased at the highest nitrogen level (concave relationship; WxN^2^).
Simulated grazing had no significant effect on productivity, but tended to reduce productivity, with warming and nitrogen addition.
At the sub-alpine site, there was no effect of warming, but nitrogen addition increased productivity, except at the highest nitrogen level (concave relationship), while simulated grazing reduces productivity.

Graminoid cover increased with warming at the sub-alpine site, but not at the alpine site (@fig-prod-cover b; @tbl-cover; Supplement @fig-biomass-fg).
Warming also tended to reduce forb cover in the alpine (similar effect size compared to graminoids), but this was not significant.
Nitrogen addition and grazing had no effect on graminoid and forb cover.
None of the drivers had any effect on sedge or legume cover.

### Diversity

The most parsimonious model for diversity and evenness was the quadratic model in the alpine and the linear for the sub-alpine. For richness, the logarithmic model was always the most parsimonious.

At the alpine site, there was a three-way interaction effect of warming, nitrogen addition and grazing on diversity and evenness (@fig-diversity) (@tbl-div).
Warming and nitrogen addition had no effect on diversity or evenness, however warming in combination with nitrogen addition above 10 kg N ha^-1^ y^-1^ decreased species diversity and evenness.
Simulated grazing alone had no effect, but in combination with warming and nitrogen addition it prevented a decrease in diversity and evenness.
Intensive simulated grazing at nitrogen addition levels between 10 to 100 kg N ha^-1^ y^-1^ diversity and evenness was even increased.
At the sub-alpine site, diversity decreased with nitrogen addition (*P* = 0.050), and for evenness there was a trend (*P* = 0.077).
Non of the drivers affected richness at any of the sites.

## Discussion

### Effects of warming and nitrogen addition

We found strong responses to three years of warming and/or nitrogen addition in terms of productivity, functional group cover and diversity in alpine and sub-alpine grasslands in Western Norway.
In particular, warming and nitrogen addition increased productivity and changed species composition.
Plant productivity increased, mainly due to an increase in productivity and abundance of graminoids while the forbs decreased in abundance (although this effect was not statistically significant).
This is in line with numerous studies in alpine grassland that have manipulated one or both of these drivers [e.g. @Klanderud2005-yx; @Humbert2016-wg] (REFs).
Unlike many other studies, we found no change in other functional groups such as legumes or sedges, which might be because they had low cover (graminoid and forb dominated habitat)?

<!-- https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.14603 -->


Interestingly, the effects were very strong at nitrogen levels beyond 10 kg N ha^-1^ y^-1^, which is far beyond the atmospheric nitrogen deposition in this region [@aas2023monitoring] and around the critical load for alpine grasslands [@bobbink2011review].
<!-- Discuss that this is higher than what we see, but why it is still useful to know. -->

The plant communities responded differently to global change in the alpine versus the sub-alpine site.
A tenfold increase in nitrogen did not change productivity much at the alpine site, however in combination with warming this lead to six times the productivity.
Contrary, at the sub-alpine site, warming increased productivity only slightly, but nitrogen addition doubled productivity.
Similarly, nitrogen was the driving force for the decline in species diversity and evenness at the sub-alpine site, and warming had only minor effects.
This suggests that the alpine plant communities are temperature limited a, while the sub-alpine communities are limited by nutrient.
<!-- Add some references or cite other examples. -->
In addition, the change in diversity was mainly driven by change in abundance (i.e. evenness) at the alpine site, while at the sub-alpine site it was mainly driven by species loss (i.e. richness; see @fig-diversity).
This suggests that change in species composition happens faster in the warmer and more productive sub-alpine site.
Together, these results suggest that the importance of different global change drivers can change with elevation, and thus different mechanisms are driving community change.


### Grazing can mitigate global change

By simulating grazing and reducing the amount of standing biomass, we were able to mitigate these negative impacts.

- grazing reduced productivity under certain circumstances (alpine WxN, sub-alpine N). This has also been found by other studies.

- The grazing levels we applied were not very high, and the plants did not overcompensate the grazing (i.e. compensate growth by plants). this could be because it is a cold environment, plants are temp limited.

- Difference to the natural grazing treatment. Basically, the results are super close to the clipping treatment, which suggests that in this system (low grazing, "small" animals), the trampling and fertilization has not much of an effect. This is good, because our experiment is realistic :-) and it also suggests that 


### The importance of stuying multiple global change drivers

- We found both single and interactive effects of warming, nitrogen addition and grazing on productivity and species composition and diversity. The single drivers did not always have an effect, but the interactions were important for productivity, diversity and evenness in the alpine. This is important, because it suggests that we might underestimate the impact if we only study single drivers.


## Other things

- treatment effects on microclimate. They are not huge, so maybe this can be mentioned in the method.

- 


## Conclusion

- We found that W and N had mainly negative effects on diversity, while grazing had a positive effect.

- With warming in the alpine things will change.

- Multiple drivers are important


## Methods

### Study area and experimental design

Three semi-natural, species rich, perennial grassland sites (469, 920, and 1290 m a.s.l) were established along an elevational gradient in Western Norway (@fig-concept d; 7.17°E, 60.88°N).
Effectively, the experimental design has only two sites (alpine and sub-alpine), because the lowland site has only transplanted communities (= warming treatment) and is thus not a separate site.
The sites were located on calcareous bedrock with loamy sand and grazed by sheep, goats and deer at the lowland and sub-alpine sites, and mostly sheep and reindeer at the alpine site.
<!-- Need some data to back this up. could also talk about season -->
Grazing pressure decreases with elevation.
Other factors such as land-use history, vegetation type, slope and exposure were kept as constant as possible.
The sites were 400 m apart in elevation, corresponding to a temperature difference of approximately 3°C in summer air, ground and soil temperature over the duration of the experiment (Supplement @fig-daily-climate).
Annual precipitation was similar at the two lowest sites and approximately 800 mm higher at the highest site (modelled climate data from the period of 2008 - 2021 by met.no).
To simulate the natural grazing regime at each site, and to avoid accumulation of biomass, the biomass within the fence was removed at the end of each field season.

In summer 2019, ten experimental blocks containing six 50 x 50 cm plots were established at each site (@fig-concept d) and fenced in early spring 2020.
In addition, two plots per block were located outside the fence (*n* = 160).
Each plot received a combination of warming, nitrogen addition and grazing treatments in two steps.
First, each block was randomly assigned a nitrogen level, to avoid nitrogen contamination between the plots within the blocks.
Second, the warming and grazing treatments were randomized within each block, with the exception of the naturally grazed plots, that were located outside the fenced area (for more details see ThreeD data paper).

At the end of the growing season in 2019, half of the plots of entire plant communities including roots were cut to a depth of 5 - 25 cm and transplanted to lower elevation, simulating an approximately 3.0 °C warmer growing season temperature.
The control plots were not excavated, because studies from similar systems have shown that the effect of transplanting does not affect species composition [@Vandvik2020-hu; @Yang2018-uq].
If necessary, loose soil was carefully removed from the underside of the turf, or local soil was added to the gap or around the edges to ensure the soil surface was in plane with the surrounding vegetation.

Each block received one of the following nitrogen treatments: 0, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 150 kg N ha^−1^ yr^−1^, where three blocks were controls and received no nitrogen addition.
Nitrogen was added as slow dissolving fertilizer as pellets (YaraBela OPTI-NS 27-0-0 (4S)).
We used oxidised nitrogen (NO~x~) formed mainly by combustion processes [@holland2005nitrogen], which are the main sources of atmospheric nitrogen deposition in remote regions (i.e., away from intensive agriculture and other sources or reduced nitrogen).
The nitrogen was added once at the start and once in the middle of the growing season from 2020 - 2022, except in 2020 at the lowest site, where the whole dose of fertilizer was applied at the start of the season.

Finally, each plot was assigned one of four grazing treatments: control (inside grazing exclosure with no grazing or clipping), simulated intermediate grazing, simulated intensive grazing or natural grazing (outside grazing exclosure).
We simulated grazing by manually clipping the vegetation using scissors, because our main focus was to understand the effect of biomass removal and we were less interested in the effect of fertilization and trampling by grazers.
The simulated intermediate and intensive grazing plots were clipped two or four times about 2-3 cm above the ground during each growing season.
The plots located outside the fence were naturally grazed by domestic and wild animals to control for the difference between grazing and clipping (i.e. selectivity of grazers and nutrients addition and trampling of grazers).

<!-- Move to appendix? -->

In 2020, the intensive grazing plots at the highest site (Liahovden) was only cut three times because it was a short growing season due to late snowmelt.
An additional cut at the end of the growing season would not have yielded any biomass.
In 2021 and 2022, we did not cut Carex species before the species composition was analysed in early August (first and second cut), because they are difficult to identify without leaf tips.

### Data collection

Microclimate data was recorded continuously every 15 minutes, between July 2019 and September 2022, using Tomst TM4 loggers [@Wild2019-nk].
Air, ground and soil temperature as well as soil moisture were measured at 15, 0 cm above and -6 cm below the ground in all warming and grazing treatments inside the fence and at 0, 1, 10, 100 and 150 kg N ha^-1^ y^-1^ (n = 72 loggers).
At the high alpine site in Norway, the block with 0.5 kg N ha^-1^ y^-1^ also received climate loggers, because this block is located further away from the rest and we wanted to make sure to catch any difference in the microcliamte.

In 2022, aboveground annual plant productivity was estimated by harvesting standing biomass over the whole growing season for the simulated grazing treatment (i.e. summing the biomass of each cut) or at the end of the growing season for the control treatment.
The biomass was harvested 2-3 cm above the ground, sorted to plant functional groups (graminoids with cyperaceae sorted separately, forbs, legumes, shrubs, bryophytes, lichen and litter as dead unattached plant material), dried at 65 °C for 72 h and weighed.
There is no estimate of annual productivity for the natural grazed plots, because the biomass was removed by the grazers.

<!-- Do we want to say this and present productivity at the 3 sties? --> 
To estimate productivity and grazing intensity outside the grazing exclosure at each site, we set up three 30 x 30 cm cages and control plots at each site.
The cages were designed to exclude mammal herbivores, but not insects (mesh with = 1 cm?).
The plots were moved every x-y days, and the biomass in each plot was harvested 2-3 cm above the ground, dried at 65°C for 72h and weighed.

Plant species composition was recorded annually at peak growing season in all plots before the treatment in 2019 and after 3 years in 2022.
We visually estimated the percentage cover of all vascular plant species to the nearest 1 % on the 25 x 25 cm inner area of each plot.
The total coverage in each plot can exceed 100, due to layering of the vegetation.
<!-- check year for lid! --> For species identification we followed the nomenclature from @Lid2010-ck.

### Statistical analysis

The effects of warming, nitrogen addition and simulated grazing and their interactions on annual productivity was analysed separately for the alpine and sub-alpine sites using a fixed effects linear model with a normal error distribution.
The model contained a three-way interaction of warming, nitrogen addition and simulated grazing as predictors.
The experimental design, did not allow running a mixed-effects model, because there is no replication at the plot level.
Simulated grazing was transformed to a numerical scale with 0 (control), 2 (intermediate) or 4 (intensive) cuts per growing season.
The nitrogen levels we chose, ranged from low to very high levels and they were unevenly distributed on a linear scale.
We did not expect a linear responses along this nitrogen gradient and therefore used three models that differed nitrogen addition treatment term reflecting separate assumptions for the response to nitrogen addition: a) a linear term as a null model (N), b) a logarithmic term (log(N)) to account for the uneven distribution of the nitrogen levels, and c) a quadratic term (N^2^) allowing for a concave/convex relationship.
To find the most parsimonious model, we compared the AIC values of all three models and chose the one with the lowest AIC values.
If the models differed in $\delta AIC \le 2$, we chose the simplest model (alpine forb cover, 3x sub-alpine cover, 2x richness, sub-alpine evenness).
We preferred the logarithmic before the linear model, because it reflects a more realistic assumption than the null model.

To test the effects of warming, nitrogen addition and simulated grazing and their interactions on change in plant functional group cover and diversity, we used the same fixed effects linear model with a normal error distribution as described above.
Change in functional group cover was calculated as the cover of each functional group (graminoids, forbs, sedges and legumes) at the end of the experiment in 2022 minus the cover before the start of the treatments in 2019.
For sedges there was only enough data to run the models from the alpine site, and for legumes only at the sub-alpine site (Supplement @fig-biomass-fg).
We calculated three diversity indices: species richness ($n$; number of species), Shannon diversity ($H' = -\sum_{i}p_{i}lnp_{i}$, where $p_{i}$ is the proportional abundance of species $i$) and species evenness ($H'/log(n)$) using the vegan package [@oksanen2022vegan] and calculated the change for each diversity index in the same way as for functional group cover.
For each of these response variables we used the same model approach as described above.

Shown are the proportion of shrubs, graminoids (without Cyperaceae), Cyperaceae (mostly Carex species), forbs, legumes, bryophytes, and litter, for the different nitrogen addition treatments in non-grazed (Control), medium and intensive grazed plots. The two top rows are the ambient and warmed plots in the alpine site, while the two lower rows are ambient and warmed plots at the subalpine site. The general pattern is that graminoids increase and forbs decrease with higher nitrogen addition treatment.

#| fig-cap: Change in functional group cover. The figure shows change in graminoid excluding sedges, forb, sedge or legume cover between 2019 (before treatment) and 2022 (after three years of treatment) with increasing nitrogen addition (kg N ha-1 y-1) in the alpine (upper row) and sub-alpine (lower row) sites. Positive numbers indicate an increase and negative numbers a decrease in functional group cover. The x axis is log transformed to better visualize lower nitrogen values, but the numbers on the x axis are on the original scale for better interpreation of the data. The colours indicate ambient (grey) and warm conditions (pink) and the shapes show the different grazing treatments (round = control, square = natural grazing). The points show the data, while the lines indicate model predictions with confidence intervals. Note that sedge and legumes only occured in high enough abundance at one of the locations to run a model.
