## Abstract 
(278!!!/200 words)

Multiple global change drivers such as climate warming, nitrogen deposition and change in grazing regimes occur simultaneously, interact and threaten alpine biodiversity.
While warmer climate and nitrogen addition generally affect diversity negatively, grazing has the potential to mitigate these negative impacts because they affect alpine plant communities through the same underlying mechanisms: change in productivity and biomass.
Most empirical global change studies however investigate only few of these drivers which underestimates the impact on biodiversity.
We studied the single and interactive effects of these three drivers on diversity in alpine and sub-alpine vascular plant communities for three years by transplanting communities to lower elevation (warming), fertilizing with nitrogen and simulate grazing by clipping.

Alpine and sub-alpine communities responded differently to the single and interactive effects of these global change drivers.
Warming increased productivity in alpine communities, while both warming and/or nitrogen lead to an increase in productivity in the sub-alpine site.
Change in productivity was mainly driven by an increase in graminoid cover and also lead to decrease in diversity and evenness.
The change in community composition was slower in the alpine and mainly driven by change in abundance, things happened faster in the sub-alpine site where we already observed change in numbers.
Simulated grazing was able to mitigate negative impacts of global change in alpine communities, but not at the sub-alpine site, possibly because grazing pressure was too low.
Benefits of grazing were larger in the more intense grazing treatment and at nitrogen levels above 10 kg N ha^-1^ y^-1^.
This study shows that grazing can mediate negative impacts of warming and nitrogen addition, and thus will be an important ecosystem management tool under future climate conditions.

## Main 
(~2400/3500 words, without abstract, ref and fig legends)

Global change is a major threat to biodiversity and is driven by multiple anthropogenic pressures such as land-use change, explotation, climate change and pollution [@Ipbes2019-sd; @rillig2019role; @jaureguiberry2022direct].
These drivers do not act in isolation, they occur simultaneously and interact.
Different global change drivers often affect the same abiotic (e.g. environmental filtering) and biotic (e.g. competition) processes that influence community composition and diversity [@grime1973competitive; @hobbs2009novel].
Global change studies however often include few drivers and not always investigate interactions which is problematic because they can underestimate the impact and make predicting global change impacts challenging [@Komatsu2019-yr; @rillig2019role; @oliver2014interactions].
To improve our understand of global change impacts on biodiversity, we need studies that manipulate multiple global change drivers and can disentangle single and combined effects.

Mountains support livelihoods for hundreds of millions, by providing biodiversity, and important ecosystem functions and services such as clean water, carbon sequestration, and grazing pastures [@egan2017mountain].
Alpine grasslands are temperature limited, have low nutrient availability and have been managed for grazing and fodder production within socio-ecological systems of transhumance or mixed agriculture for centuries [@Austrheim2001-nu; @Bunce2004-kn].
During the last decades, mountains have warmed faster than the average [@Ipcc2022-jw; @pepin2015elevation] and climate change impacts in alpine habitats have been studied extensively [@verrall2020alpine; @harte1995shifting; @inouye2020effects].
At the same time mountains are affected by other drivers such as atmospheric nitrogen deposition and change in grazing regimes [@Humbert2016-wg; @Austrheim2001-nu; @macdonald2000agricultural], where land abandonment and reduced grazing are especially common in European mountains [@Austrheim2001-nu; @li2017global].
Warming, nitrogen addition and reduced grazing occur simultaneously, they interact and impact alpine plant communities and diversity through the same underlying mechanisms: change in productivity and aboveground standing biomass (@fig-concept a).

Warmer climate and nitrogen deposition both positively affect plant productivity, leading to more standing biomass and potentially a positive feedback to plant productivity (@fig-concept a) [@fu2015meta; @rustad2001meta; @Humbert2016-wg].
The relationship between standing biomass and plant diversity is non-linear and generally highest at low to intermediate biomass (@fig-concept b).
Colder and nutrient-poor grasslands, characterised by facilitative species interactions [@bertness1994positive; @choler2001facilitation], often support low-productiv plant communities with little standing biomass, but are relatively species rich (peak in @fig-concept b)[@milchunas1993quantitative; @grime1973competitive].
In contrast, warmer and productive grasslands have more standing biomass and usually favour few dominant and more competitive species, leading to a decrease in diversity (right side in @fig-concept b)[@grime1973competitive].
Warming and nitrogen addition can increase diversity in a cold and low productive grassland, however in more productive systems, they often lead to diversity loss (grey area in @fig-concept b) [@Humbert2016-wg; @steinbauer2018accelerated].
Combined effects of warming and nitrogen addition decrease diversity and are often additive [@yue2020changes; @Klanderud2005-yx].

Grazers impact plant communities through the same mechanisms, but in a more complex way.
They remove biomass and can stimulate plant productivity via nutrient addition such as urin and/or dung (@fig-concept a).
<!-- Plants can compensate the loss of biomass with compensatory growth if grazing intensity is moderate (McNaughton 1983). --> The net effect of grazing on plant diversity can thus be positive or negative and depends on grazing intensity, grazing history, and environmental context (e.g. moisture, temperature and/or nutrients) [@milchunas1988generalized; @milchunas1993quantitative; @cingolani2005grazing].
In low productive systems where facilitative interactions are common, grazing will likely have a negative impact on diversity.
However, in slightly more productive systems, the removal of biomass can release competition and increase diversity (grey area in @fig-concept b and c) [@Austrheim2001-nu; @Bernes2015-yg; @niedrist2009plant].
Grazing is often managed locally and at short time scales and is thus suitable as an ecosystem management tool.
Because grazing acts via the same pathways, it has the potential to mitigate the negative impacts of warming and nitrogen addition on alpine diversity.
There are numerous global change studies in alpine grasslands, but surprisingly few studies have manipulated multiple global change drivers [but see @Zhu2015-jw].

The aim of this study is to disentangle the single and combined effects of warmer climate, nitrogen addition and grazing on plant productivity and diversity in alpine grasslands.
In addition, we test if grazing can mediate negative impacts of warming and nitrogen addition on diversity.
We used a fully factorial and replicated field experiment at an alpine and a sub-alpine site in Western Norway, representing different annual and summer temperature as well as plant productivity.
Alpine plant communities were exposed to a combination of warmer climate (transplant to lower elevation), increased nitrogen deposition (ranging between 0 and 150 kg N ha^-1^ y^-1^), and simulated grazing by clipping and removing biomass at two different intensities (@fig-concept d).
Plant communities moved to lower elevation experienced an approximately 3°C higher average summer temperature (air: `r summer_T$diff[1]` ± `r summer_T$se_diff[1]` °C, ground: `r summer_T$diff[2]` ± `r summer_T$se_diff[2]` °C, and soil: `r summer_T$diff[3]` ± `r summer_T$se_diff[3]` °C; Supplement @fig-daily-climate).
<!-- a bit unsure if the N deposition is correct --> We chose a large range of nitrogen levels to simulate nitrogen addition close to and well beyond the atmospheric nitrogen deposition in the mountains in southern Norway (2-3 kg N ha^−1^ yr^−1^) [@aas2023monitoring] and the critical load for change in species composition in alpine grasslands (c. 5-10 kg N ha^−1^ yr^−1^) [@bobbink2011review].
We simulated grazing by clipping because our main interest was in the effect of biomass removal, however, we also had naturally grazed plots outside the fenced area to account for the difference of grazing by animals and clipping.
After three years of treatment, annual plant productivity was estimated by harvesting standing biomass and the change in vascular plant species composition and diversity was assessed.
We hypothesised that warming and nitrogen addition increase annual aboveground plant productivity and decrease vascular plant diversity, by favouring competitive graminoids [@grime1973competitive; @Klanderud2005-yx].
We also expect stronger responses to warming and nitrogen addition at the alpine compared to the sub-alpine site, because it is more temperature and nutrient limited.
Finally, we expected grazing to reduce standing biomass and avoid of species loss, especially in the sub-alpine site, where competitive release might be more important than facilitation.

## Results

### Annual productivity and functional group cover

The most parsimonious model for annual productivity and sedge cover was the quadratic model, and for all other functional group cover the logarithmic model.

Annual productivity decreased with elevation and was four times lower in the alpine (37.1 ± 13.3 g m^-2^ y^-1^) compared to the sub-alpine site (149 ± 9.5 g m^-2^ y^-1^; @fig-prod-cover a; @tbl-prod).
Warming increased annual productivity almost four times in alpine plant communities (140 ± 19.6 g m^-2^ y^-1^), but there was no change in productivity with addition of nitrogen.
Productivity showed a concave relationship with warming and nitrogen addition and increased exponentially up to 100 kg N m^-2^ y^-1^ ad dropped at the highest nitrogen level (WxN^2^).
Peak productivity with warming and nitrogen addition (235 ± 24.8 g m^-2^ y^-1^) was five times higher than under ambient condition and without nitrogen.
Simulated grazing tended to reduce productivity under warming, but this effect was only marginal significant.

Productivity under ambient conditions in the sub-alpine site was similar to productivity of warmed alpine communities.
Warming increased productivity in sub-alpine communities 1.5 times, but this was not significant.
The response in productivity to nitrogen addition was a concave relationship (N^2^), very similar to the warmed alpine community, and also reached peak productivity of 313 ± 22.2 g m^-2^ y^-1^ at 100 kg N m^-2^ y^-1^.
<!-- maybe a bit much? -->
The combination of warming and nitrogen addition increased productivity to a level of 186 ± 15.2 g m^-2^ y^-1^ (only a trend!), which was higher than under ambient conditions at the lower nitrogen levels, but lower at high nitrogen levels.
Simulated grazing reduced productivity at the sub-alpine site, but not in combination with warming or nitrogen.

Graminoid cover increased with warming in sub-alpine plant communities, but not at the alpine site (@fig-prod-cover b; @tbl-cover; Supplement @fig-biomass-fg).
Warming also tended to reduce forb cover in the alpine site (similar effect size compared to graminoids), but this effect was not significant.
Nitrogen addition and grazing had no effect on graminoid and forb cover and none of the drivers had any effect on sedge or legume cover.

### Diversity indices

The most parsimonious model for diversity and evenness was the quadratic model in the alpine and the linear for the sub-alpine.
For richness, the logarithmic model was always the most parsimonious.

At the alpine site, warming and simulated grazing tended to increase diversity and evenness (marginally significant; WxG), while warming and nitrogen addition tended to decrease diversity, in particular above 10 kg N ha^-1^ y^-1^ (marginal significant effect; WxN^2^, @fig-diversity, @tbl-div).
There was however a three-way interaction effect of warming, nitrogen addition and simulated grazing on diversity and evenness.
Simulated grazing in combination with warming and nitrogen addition prevented a decrease in diversity and evenness above 10 kg N ha^-1^ y^-1^.
For the intensive grazing treatment and at nitrogen levels between 10 to 100 kg N ha^-1^ y^-1^ diversity and evenness was even increased.

At the sub-alpine site, diversity decreased with nitrogen addition (*P* = 0.050), and for evenness there was a trend (*P* = 0.077).
Non of the drivers affected richness at any of the sites.

Overall, the three drivers affected diversity and evenness similarly in alpine communities, and richness and diversity in sub-alpine communities.

## Discussion

### Effects of warming and nitrogen addition on productivity and diversity

We found strong responses to warming and/or nitrogen addition in annual productivity in alpine and sub-alpine grasslands in Western Norway.
Productivity generally increased, but the magnitude of the response differed between the drivers and with elevation (@fig-prod-cover a).
<!-- Something on productivity values are similar at least in sub-alpine to other studies: @winkler2016soil: has similar amounts of productivity compared to us, also Körner has similar values. -->
The alpine plant community increased productivity with warming, and in combination with nitrogen addition, which has been found by numerous studies [@elmendorf2012global; @Klanderud2005-yx].
Warming can directly increase productivity because of higher rates of photosynthesis, a longer growing season or indirectly higher microbial activity can increasing nutrient availability.
However, we found no increase in productivity to nitrogen addition alone, which contradicts other studies [@Humbert2016-wg; @Klanderud2005-yx].
This suggests that these communities are mainly limited by temperature, and even adding 100 kg N ha^-1^ y^-1^ does not change productivity.
Plants in cold climate might not be able to use the additional nitrogen to produce biomass (REFs), or they are limited by other nutrients and only adding nitrogen does not promote growth (see Klanderud 2005, in a similar habitat where nutrients were added).
Interestingly, under warming, there was an exponential increase in productivity with nitrogen reaching up to 250 g m^-2^ y^-1^.
The sub-alpine plant community showed a very similar pattern with nitrogen, starting at c. 100 g m^-2^ y^-1^ and reaching around 300 g m^-2^ y^-1^.
The alpine community thus reaches similar levels of productivity compared to the sub-alpine community, suggesting that alpine plant communities are not less productive, but are limited by the length of the growing season and temperature (Körner 2003).
<!-- and studies have shown that productivity responses to warming are larger in cold environments [@rustad2001meta; @lin2010climate]. we find a bit the opposite-->
Sub-alpine communities that were warmed increased productivity to around 200 g m^-2^ y^-1^, but were not able to use the additional nitrogen.
One explanation for this could be that the conditions at the lowest site were drier (@fig-climate) and thus limit growth [@winkler2016soil].
<!-- warming and N: increase in productivity [@Humbert2016-wg; @elmendorf2012plot]. -->
<!-- https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.14603 -->
<!-- WXN: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722060223 -->

<!-- What causes these changes? -->
Change in productivity can also result from changes in species composition.
We found that especially with warming the abundance of graminoids increased, which has been found previously [@Elmendorf2012plot].
Graminoids are often fast growing and more competitive.
<!-- A bit unsure what I should say about forbs. non significant trend, but they decrease in the alpine -->
Unlike other studies, we found no change in the abundance of other functional groups such as forbs, legumes or sedges.
This is partly because these are forb and graminoid dominated grasslands and other functional groups had low abundance.


Warming often increases while nitrogen addition tends to decreases species richness and diversity in alpine grasslands [@Humbert2016-wg; @elmendorf2012global].
We found only a slight decrease in diversity with warming and nitrogen addition in alpine plant communities and a strong decrease in diversity and evenness at the sub-alpine site, but no responses in richness.
Our study observed short-term responses (3 years), which can differ from long-term responses.
Especially in cold environments, community changes are slow (REF), which could explain stronger responses in the sub-alpine community.
In addition, changes in abundance generally happens faster than species turnover (i.e. colonization or extinction) (REF) and in alpine communities there is often an extinction lag [@dullinger2012extinction; @alexander2018lags; @Vandvik2020-hu].
We mainly observed change in abundance in the alpine communities (i.e. change in diversity and evenness are similar in @fig-diversity) and also change in richness in the sub-alpine site (i.e. change in diversity and richness are similar in @fig-diversity).
These results suggest that alpine and sub-alpine plant communities respond differently to these global change drivers.
<!-- Where should this go and check values for sub-alpine sites -->
Interestingly, these plant communities tended to change in productivity and diversity beyond the addition of 10 kg N ha^-1^ y^-1^, which is the around the critical load for alpine and sub-alpine grasslands [@bobbink2011review].


### Grazing can mitigate negative impacts of global change

Moderate grazing has been shown to increase species richness and diversity in alpine grasslands [@Austrheim2001-nu; @Bernes2015-yg; @niedrist2009plant; @klein2004experimental].
This is because grazing induces competitive release in plant communities due to a shift from dominant to less competitive and rare species.
Net effects of grazing on plant community composition are however complex and depend on a number of factors including grazing intensity, grazing history, and environmental context (i.e. productivity) [@milchunas1988generalized; @milchunas1993quantitative; @cingolani2005grazing].
In our study, the relationship between productivity and diversity was negatively correlated (@fig-summary a), suggesting that moderate grazing could remove biomass and thus increase diversity (grey area in @fig-concept b and c).
Indeed, we found that simulated grazing prevents the loss of diversity and evenness at the alpine site with warming and nitrogen levels above 10 kg N ha^-1^ y^-1^ (@fig-diversity, @fig-summary b).
Grazing was only beneficial for diversity with the intensive grazing treatment, suggesting that the medium grazing treatment was too low.

In the sub-alpine plant community, grazing reduce productivity under ambient conditions and no nitrogen addition, however there was no benefit of grazing for diversity (@fig-prod-cover).
This suggests that both of our simulated grazing treatments were too low to reduce the biomass considerably at the sub-alpine site, where productivity was four times higher than at the alpine site.
We acknowledge that there is a difference between cutting biomass and herbivore grazing and that our simulated grazing treatment might not reflect real grazing, but usually these differences are small [@talle2016grazing].
However, we found the same results with natural grazing (i.e. sheep, deer and reindeer; @fig-cover-CN, @fig-diversity-CN) compared to clipping, suggesting that our simulated grazing treatment is comparable to natural grazing and additional trampling and fertilization from the animals did not have a strong effect.
<!-- They also found similar effects of grazing and clipping: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2004.00677.x -->
We show that grazing can mediate negative impacts of warming and nitrogen addition.
However, whether grazing benefits diversity depends strongly on the environmental context and grazing intensity, and information about these are necessary to inform adaptive management strategies that benefit biodiversity. 

<!-- But plants did not overcompensate grazing by growth!!! -->


### The importance of stuying multiple global change drivers

We found both single and interactive effects of warming, nitrogen addition and grazing on productivity and species composition and diversity.
The importance of interactive effects varied with elevation and the response variable and we found interactive effects to be important for productivity, diversity and evenness in the alpine community (@fig-summary c).
Our study suggests that it is important to study multiple drivers simultaneously, because only looking at single effects might underestimate their impact [@Komatsu2019-yr].


## Conclusion

-   Global change will change alpine and sub-alpine plant communities.

-   We found that W and N had mainly negative effects on diversity, while grazing had the potential to mitigate those negative effects.

-   Multiple drivers are important and they vary with context

-   The knowledge about these drivers allow for adaptive management


## Methods

### Study area and experimental design

Three semi-natural, species rich, perennial grassland sites (469, 920, and 1290 m a.s.l) were established along an elevational gradient in Western Norway (@fig-concept d; 7.17°E, 60.88°N).
Effectively, the experimental design has only two sites (alpine and sub-alpine), because the lowland site has only transplanted communities (= warming treatment) and is thus not a separate site.
The sites were located on calcareous bedrock with loamy sand and grazed by sheep, goats and deer at the lowland and sub-alpine sites, and mostly sheep and reindeer at the alpine site.
<!-- Need some data to back this up. could also talk about season --> Grazing pressure decreases with elevation.
Other factors such as land-use history, vegetation type, slope and exposure were kept as constant as possible.
The sites were 400 m apart in elevation, corresponding to a temperature difference of approximately 3°C in summer air, ground and soil temperature over the duration of the experiment (Supplement @fig-daily-climate).
Annual precipitation was similar at the two lowest sites and approximately 800 mm higher at the highest site (modelled climate data from the period of 2008 - 2021 by met.no).
To simulate the natural grazing regime at each site, and to avoid accumulation of biomass, the biomass within the fence was removed at the end of each field season.

In summer 2019, ten experimental blocks containing six 50 x 50 cm plots were established at each site (@fig-concept d) and fenced in early spring 2020.
In addition, two plots per block were located outside the fence (*n* = 160).
Each plot received a combination of warming, nitrogen addition and grazing treatments in two steps.
First, each block was randomly assigned a nitrogen level, to avoid nitrogen contamination between the plots within the blocks.
Second, the warming and grazing treatments were randomized within each block, with the exception of the naturally grazed plots, that were located outside the fenced area (for more details see ThreeD data paper).

At the end of the growing season in 2019, half of the plots of entire plant communities including roots were cut to a depth of 5 - 25 cm and transplanted to lower elevation, simulating an approximately 3.0 °C warmer growing season temperature.
The control plots were not excavated, because studies from similar systems have shown that the effect of transplanting does not affect species composition [@Vandvik2020-hu; @Yang2018-uq].
If necessary, loose soil was carefully removed from the underside of the turf, or local soil was added to the gap or around the edges to ensure the soil surface was in plane with the surrounding vegetation.

Each block received one of the following nitrogen treatments: 0, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 150 kg N ha^−1^ yr^−1^, where three blocks were controls and received no nitrogen addition.
Nitrogen was added as slow dissolving fertilizer as pellets (YaraBela OPTI-NS 27-0-0 (4S)).
We used oxidised nitrogen (NO~x~) formed mainly by combustion processes [@holland2005nitrogen], which are the main sources of atmospheric nitrogen deposition in remote regions (i.e., away from intensive agriculture and other sources or reduced nitrogen).
The nitrogen was added once at the start and once in the middle of the growing season from 2020 - 2022, except in 2020 at the lowest site, where the whole dose of fertilizer was applied at the start of the season.

Finally, each plot was assigned one of four grazing treatments: control (inside grazing exclosure with no grazing or clipping), simulated intermediate grazing, simulated intensive grazing or natural grazing (outside grazing exclosure).
We simulated grazing by manually clipping the vegetation using scissors, because our main focus was to understand the effect of biomass removal and we were less interested in the effect of fertilization and trampling by grazers.
The simulated intermediate and intensive grazing plots were clipped two or four times about 2-3 cm above the ground during each growing season.
The plots located outside the fence were naturally grazed by domestic and wild animals to control for the difference between grazing and clipping (i.e. selectivity of grazers and nutrients addition and trampling of grazers).

<!-- Move to appendix? -->

In 2020, the intensive grazing plots at the highest site (Liahovden) was only cut three times because it was a short growing season due to late snowmelt.
An additional cut at the end of the growing season would not have yielded any biomass.
In 2021 and 2022, we did not cut Carex species before the species composition was analysed in early August (first and second cut), because they are difficult to identify without leaf tips.

### Data collection

Microclimate data was recorded continuously every 15 minutes, between July 2019 and September 2022, using Tomst TM4 loggers [@Wild2019-nk].
Air, ground and soil temperature as well as soil moisture were measured at 15, 0 cm above and -6 cm below the ground in all warming and grazing treatments inside the fence and at 0, 1, 10, 100 and 150 kg N ha^-1^ y^-1^ (n = 72 loggers).
At the high alpine site in Norway, the block with 0.5 kg N ha^-1^ y^-1^ also received climate loggers, because this block is located further away from the rest and we wanted to make sure to catch any difference in the microcliamte.
<!-- NEED TO CHECK IF HIGH N VALUES HAVE EFFECT IN ALPIN!!! -->
The warming treatment increased air, ground and soil temperature by c. 3 °C and decreased soil moisture (@fig-daily-climate, @fig-climate), but nitrogen addition and grazing had no effect on the microclimate (@fig-climate).

In 2022, aboveground annual plant productivity was estimated by harvesting standing biomass over the whole growing season for the simulated grazing treatment (i.e. summing the biomass of each cut) or at the end of the growing season for the control treatment.
The biomass was harvested 2-3 cm above the ground, sorted to plant functional groups (graminoids with cyperaceae sorted separately, forbs, legumes, shrubs, bryophytes, lichen and litter as dead unattached plant material), dried at 65 °C for 72 h and weighed.
There is no estimate of annual productivity for the natural grazed plots, because the biomass was removed by the grazers.

<!-- Do we want to say this and present productivity at the 3 sties? -->

To estimate productivity and grazing intensity outside the grazing exclosure at each site, we set up three 30 x 30 cm cages and control plots at each site.
The cages were designed to exclude mammal herbivores, but not insects (mesh with = 1 cm?).
The plots were moved every x-y days, and the biomass in each plot was harvested 2-3 cm above the ground, dried at 65°C for 72h and weighed.

Plant species composition was recorded annually at peak growing season in all plots before the treatment in 2019 and after 3 years in 2022.
We visually estimated the percentage cover of all vascular plant species to the nearest 1 % on the 25 x 25 cm inner area of each plot.
The total coverage in each plot can exceed 100, due to layering of the vegetation.
<!-- check year for lid! --> For species identification we followed the nomenclature from @Lid2010-ck.

### Statistical analysis

The effects of warming, nitrogen addition and simulated grazing and their interactions on annual productivity was analysed separately for the alpine and sub-alpine sites using a fixed effects linear model with a normal error distribution.
The model contained a three-way interaction of warming, nitrogen addition and simulated grazing as predictors.
The experimental design, did not allow running a mixed-effects model, because there is no replication at the plot level.
Simulated grazing was transformed to a numerical scale with 0 (control), 2 (intermediate) or 4 (intensive) cuts per growing season.
The nitrogen levels we chose, ranged from low to very high levels and they were unevenly distributed on a linear scale.
We did not expect a linear responses along this nitrogen gradient and therefore used three models that differed nitrogen addition treatment term reflecting separate assumptions for the response to nitrogen addition: a) a linear term as a null model (N), b) a logarithmic term (log(N)) to account for the uneven distribution of the nitrogen levels, and c) a quadratic term (N^2^) allowing for a concave/convex relationship.
To find the most parsimonious model, we compared the AIC values of all three models and chose the one with the lowest AIC values.
If the models differed in $\delta AIC \le 2$, we chose the simplest model (alpine forb cover, 3x sub-alpine cover, 2x richness, sub-alpine evenness).
We preferred the logarithmic before the linear model, because it reflects a more realistic assumption than the null model.

To test the effects of warming, nitrogen addition and simulated grazing and their interactions on change in plant functional group cover and diversity, we used the same fixed effects linear model with a normal error distribution as described above.
Change in functional group cover was calculated as the cover of each functional group (graminoids, forbs, sedges and legumes) at the end of the experiment in 2022 minus the cover before the start of the treatments in 2019.
For sedges there was only enough data to run the models from the alpine site, and for legumes only at the sub-alpine site (Supplement @fig-biomass-fg).
We calculated three diversity indices: species richness ($n$; number of species), Shannon diversity ($H' = -\sum_{i}p_{i}lnp_{i}$, where $p_{i}$ is the proportional abundance of species $i$) and species evenness ($H'/log(n)$) using the vegan package [@oksanen2022vegan] and calculated the change for each diversity index in the same way as for functional group cover.
For each of these response variables we used the same model approach as described above.
