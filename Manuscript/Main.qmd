## Abstract


## Main

Mountains support livelihoods for hundreds of millions, by providing biodiversity, and important ecosystem functions and services such as clean water, carbon sequestration, and grazing pastures [@egan2017mountain].
Alpine ecosystems are temperature limited, have low nutrient availability and have been managed for grazing and fodder production within socio-ecological systems of transhumance or mixed agriculture for centuries [@Austrheim2008-nu; @Bunce2004-kn].
During the last decades, mountains have been impacted by multiple global change drivers such as land-use change, climate change and pollution threatening biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services and human well-being (some IPBES report).
Need to specifically name the 3 drivers: grazing main land-use change globally (IPCC, 2019: Summary for Policymakers), mountains are warming faster than global average and nitrogen one of the most important global change drivers (Galloway 2008).

Now I have added a full sentence here!

These global change drivers can occur simultaneously and impact plant communities through the same underlying mechanisms: change in productivity and biomass (@fig-concept a).
Productivity and biomass are linked and higher productivity generally increases the amount of biomass, which generates a positive feedback to plant productivity (Noy-Meir 1975?).
Warmer climate and nitrogen deposition often (in)directly increase nutrient availability (e.g. longer growing season), with a positive effect on plant productivity and biomass (fig a and arrows in fig-concept b).
Grazing affects the same mechanisms in a more complex way, by increasing productivity via nutrient input (urin, dung), and also decreasing biomass.
The net outcome for productivity depends on the grazing intensity and environmental context and is a non-linear relationship with the highest productivity at intermediate grazing intensity (McNaughton, 1979; Milchunas & Lauenroth, 1993).

The relationship between biomass/productivity and diversity is non-linear and context dependent (@fig-concept b).
Colder and nutrient-poor ecosystems often support low-productivity plant communities with little biomass, but which are often relatively species rich (Grime, 1973; Milchunas & Lauenroth, 1993). Such communities are often characterised by facilitative species interactions (Bertness and Callaway 1994; Choler, Michalet, and Callaway 2001; Cavieres et al. 2014).
Productive plant communities usually have increased competition for light and nutrients among species and lower species diversity (Grime 1973; Collins et al. 1998; Bernes et al. 2015). 
Removal of biomass via grazing can therefore be positive for diversity, where productivity is high and creates competitive release (fig grey area), but less so in low productive systems (Gunnar Austrheim and Eriksson 2008; Bernes et al. 2015).
Grazing is also the driver that occurs on a local and short-term scale and can therefore be more easily manipulated compared to warming and nitrogen addition and thus has the potential to be an ecosystem management tool.
Surprisingly few studies look at the interaction of multiple global change drivers in alpine grassland.

Here we aim to disentangle the single and combined effects of warmer climate, nitrogen addition and grazing on plant productivity and biodiversity in alpine grasslands and test if grazing can mediate negative impacts of warming and nitrogen addition on biodiversity. 
We used a fully factorial, large scale, and replicated field experiment in an alpine grassland sites along an elevational gradient, representing a productivity gradient, in Western Norway.
Alpine plant communities were exposed to warmer climate (transplant to lower elevation), increased nitrogen deposition (N addition), and we simulated grazing by removing biomass at two different intensities, because our main interest was in the effect of biomass removal. 
We hypothesised that warming and nitrogen addition increase annual aboveground plant productivity and decrease vascular plant diversity, by favouring competitive graminoids (Klanderud & Totland 2005). 
However, grazing can mitigate these impacts by reducing productivity, and avoid species loss. 
And finally, we expect stronger responses at higher elevation/low productive site, because it is more temperature and nutrient limited and facilitation is more important.

```

The temperature varied on average between the sites (~400 m) by `X[1,2]` °C for air temperature, `X[2,2]` °C for ground temperature, and `X[3,2]` °C for soil temperature.
Soil moisture decreased with elevation from 0.388 % at the alpine site, 0.307 % at the subalpine site and 0.259 % at the lowest site.
2021 was the warmest and wettest year with an average air temperature of 10.18 °C and 0.25 % soil moisture content. 2019 was the coldest and wettest year with an average air temperature of 6.18 °C (Supplement Figure S1).


Average summer temperature was 3.16 °C (air), 3.22 °C (ground), and 3.10 °C (soil) higher in the warming treatment (transplant) compared to the controls across all the sites (Supplement Figure S1).
Soil moisture was significantly lower in the warming treatment.
Temperature did not differ among the grazing or different nitrogen addition levels.
However, soil moisture was higher in the intensive grazing treatment, and decreased with increasing nitrogen addition.


### Annual productivity and functional group cover

Annual productivity decreased with elevation and was 3-6 times higher in the sub-alpine site, compared to the alpine site.
At the alpine site, annual productivity increases 119 g m^-2^ y^-1^ with warming and more in combination with nitrogen addition.
Productivity was highest at 100 g N m^-2^ y^-1^, but decreased at the highest nitrogen level (concave relationship; WxN^2^).
Grazing had no effect on productivity, but tended to reduce productivity, when productivity was highest.
At the sub-alpine site, nitrogen addition increased productivity, except for the highest level (concave relationship), while grazing reduces productivity.
There was no effect of warming.

Graminoid cover increased with warming in the alpine and sub-alpine site.
Warming also tended to reduce forb cover (similar effect size compared to grmainoids), but this was not significant.
Nitrogen addition and grazing had no effect on graminoid and forb cover.

### Diversity

At the alpine site, there was a three-way interaction among warming, nitrogen addition and grazing on diversity and evenness.
Warming and increasing nitrogen addition decreased diversity and evenness, however increased grazing reduced this negative impact on diversity and evenness, especially up to 100 kg N ha^-1^ y^-1^.
These negative impacts were not reduced above 150 kg N ha^-1^ y^-1^.
At the sub-alpine site, diversity decreased with nitrogen addition, and for evenness there was a trend for decreasing with nitrogen addition (*P* = 0.056).
Non of the drivers affected richness at any of the sites.

## Methods

### Study area and experimental design

Three semi-natural, species rich, and perennial grassland sites (469, 920, 1290 m a.s.l) were established along an elevational gradient in Western Norway (@fig-experiment; 7.17°E, 60.88°N).
The sites were located on calcareous bedrock with loamy sand and dominantly grazed by sheep, goats, deer and reindeer.
Other factors such as land-use history, vegetation type, slope and exposure were kept as constant as possible.
The sites were 400 m apart in elevation, corresponding to a temperature difference of approximately 3°C in summer air temperature over the duration of the experiment (FIG/TABL in appendix).
Annual precipitation was similar at the two lowest sites and approximately 800 mm higher at the higest site (modelled climate data from the period of 2008 - 2021 by met.no).

The arrows indicate the direction of transplant.

```

In summer 2019, ten experimental blocks containing six 50 x 50 cm plots (*n* = 120) were established at each site (for more details see ThreeD data paper) and fenced in early spring 2020.
Each plot received a combination of warming, nitrogen addition and grazing treatments in two steps.
First, each block was randomly assigned a nitrogen level, to avoid nitrogen contamination between the plots within the blocks.
Second, the warming and grazing treatments were then randomized within each block.

At the end of the growing season in 2019, half of the plots of entire plant communities including roots were cut to a depth of 5 - 25 cm and transplanted to lower elevation, simulating an approximately 3.0 °C warmer growing season temperature (@fig-experiment).
The control plots were not excavated, because the effect of transplanting should not affect species composition [@Vandvik2020-hu; @Yang2018-uq].
If necessary, loose soil was carefully removed from the underside of the turf, or local soil was added to the gap or around the edges to ensure the soil surface was in plane with the surrounding vegetation

Each block received one of the following nitrogen treatments: 0, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 150 kg N ha^−1^ yr^−1^, where three blocks were controls and received no nitrogen addition. 
Nitrogen was added as slow dissolving fertilizer as pellets (YaraBela OPTI-NS 27-0-0 (4S)). 
We used oxidised nitrogen (NOx) formed mainly by combustion processes [@holland2005nitrogen], which are the main sources of atmospheric nitrogen deposition in remote regions (i.e., away from intensive agriculture and other sources or reduced nitrogen).
The nitrogen was added once at the start and once in the middle of the growing season from 2020 - 2022, except in 2020 at the lowest site, where the whole dose of fertilizer was applied at the start of the season.
<!-- Move to appendix? -->
The natural annual atmospheric nitrogen deposition in Western Norway is 1.5-3.5 kg N ha^−1^ yr^−1^.
The critical load for changing species composition in alpine grasslands is approximately 5-10 kg N ha^−1^ yr^−1^.
We chose a range of nitrogen levels that were below and well above this critical load.

Finally, each plot was assigned one of three grazing treatments: grazing exclosure (control), simulated intermediate grazing, or simulated intensive grazing. 
We simulated grazing by clipping the vegetation manually, because our main focus was the effect of biomass removal and not the fertilization and trampling effect of the grazers (-> move to intro?).
The simulated intermediate and intensive grazing plots were manually clipped using scissors two or four times during each growing season, 2-3 cm above the ground.
Plots were also located outside the fence and naturally grazed by domestic and wild animals to control for the difference between grazing and clipping (i.e. selectivity of grazers and nutrients addition and trampling of grazers) (see appendix).

<!-- Move to appendix? -->
In 2020, the intensive grazing plots at the highest site (Liahovden) was only cut three times because it was a short growing season due to late snowmelt.
An additional cut at the end of the growing season would not have yielded any biomass.
In 2021 and 2022, we did not cut Carex species before the species composition was analysed in early August (first and second cut), because they are difficult to identify without leaf tips.
To simulate the natural grazing regime at each site, and to avoid accumulation of biomass, the biomass within the fence was removed at the end of each field season.


### Data collection

Microclimate data was recorded continuously (every 15 min), between July 2019 and September 2022, using Tomst TM4 loggers [@Wild2019-nk].
Air, ground and soil temperature as well as soil moisture were measured at 15, 0 and -6 cm above or below the ground in all warming and grazing treatments inside the fence and at 0, 0.5, 1, 10, 100 and 150 kg N ha^-1^ y^-1^ (total logger: n = 72 ).
At the high alpine site in Norway, the block with 0.5 kg N ha^-1^ y^-1^ also received climate loggers, because this block are located further away from the other blocks.

To estimate annual above ground plant productivity, the biomass in all plots was harvested 2-3 cm above the ground at peak growing season in 2022.
The biomass was sorted to plant functional groups (graminoids with cyperaceae sorted separately, forbs, legumes, shrubs, bryophytes, lichen and litter; dead unattached plant material), dried at 65 °C for 72h and weighed. 
For the simulated grazing treatments the biomass of each cut (see above) during the growing season was summed to calculate annual productivity.

Plant species composition was recorded at peak growing season in all plots before starting the treatments in 2019 and annually until 2022.
We visually estimated the percentage cover of all vascular plant species to the nearest 1 % on the 25 x 25 cm inner area of each plot.
The total coverage in each plot can exceed 100, due to layering of the vegetation.
For species identification we followed the nomenclature from @Lid2010-ck.


### Statistical analysis

The effect of warming, nitrogen addition and simulated grazing and their interactions on annual productivity were analysed with a linear model with a normal error distribution.
The experimental design, did not allow running a mixed-effects model, because there is no replication at the plot level.
Instead there is a gradient of seven Nitrogen levels.
We did not expect a linear response along this gradient, and added a quadratic term for Nitrogen addition.
Grazing was transformed to a numerical scale with 0, 2 or 4 cuts.
We compared models with a linear term for nitrogen, log transformed and quadratic term for nitrogen.
Tested log transformed vs quadratic term: in most cases quadratic model gives better R^2.
Compared linear vs quadratic model with AIC values and chose the better one.
Model assumptions?

Change in functional group cover and diversity indices was analysed using the same model and approach.
Separate models were run for each functional group.
Change in functional group cover was calculated as the cover of each functional group (graminoids, forbs, sedges and legumes) at the end of the experiment in 2022 minus the cover before the start of the treatments in 2019.
We calculated 3 diversity indices, species richness (number of species), diversity and species evenness (Shannon diversity/log[richness]) using the vegan package (REF).
The change in diversity indices was calculated in the same way as for cover.

The data is openly available on OSF.
All data transformation and analysis was done in R and the code to download the data and run the analysis in (a hopefully) full reproducible way are available on GitHub.
