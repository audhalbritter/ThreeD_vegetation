    "text": "[Global change] Anthropogenic global changes linked to land-use change, resource exploitation, climate change, invasive alien species, and pollution pose major and accelerating threats to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (1). These global change drivers do not act in isolation, however, but occur simultaneously and often interact in complex ways so that their cumulative impacts may exceed the sum of single drivers (2, 3). The vast majority of empirical global change studies focus on only one, or perhaps two drivers, and rarely assess interactions (4, 5). This is problematic because such studies may underestimate the overall pressures on biodiversity, thereby limiting our ability to predict the consequences of projected climate and environmental changes (2–4, 6). To improve our understanding of global change impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, now and in the future, we therefore urgently need studies that explicitly consider multiple global change drivers and their interactions.\n[Mountains and GC] Mountains harbor unique biodiversity and provide important ecosystem functions and services such as carbon sequestration, water cycling, and grazing pastures; underpinning the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people (7). In many regions of the world, alpine vegetation has been managed for grazing and fodder production within socio-ecological systems of transhumance or mixed agriculture for centuries (8, 9). During the last decades, faster warming at higher elevations have been observed at many mountain ranges(10–12) and climate change impacts have changed species distributions (13), community structure and dynamics (14, 15), and ecosystem functioning (1, 16, 17) along elevational gradients. At the same time alpine ecosystems are affected by other global change drivers such as atmospheric nitrogen deposition (18) and change in land use, including both intensification and abandonment of grazing regimes (8, 19, 20).\n[Mechanism] In alpine vegetation, including grassland, heath, and tundra, plant productivity is generally temperature limited and warmer climate will thus often result in increased plant growth, leading to more standing biomass (21, 22), with a positive feedback to productivity (Figure 3.1 a). These vegetation changes have implications for biodiversity, operating via changes in the nature and intensity of species interactions within alpine plant communities. In particular, as climate warms and biomass increases, we expect a shift from the facilitative plant-plant interactions that tend to dominate under high environmental stress towards the competitive interactions characteristic of more environmentally benign conditions, in line with the ‘Stress Gradient Hypothesis’; see e.g. (23, 24). These shifts in the direction and intensity of the dominant plant-plant interactions in response to warming may again lead to changes in species composition and diversity, with lower-stature and less competitive alpine specialist species decreasing in abundance and diversity as they are exposed to increased competition for light from a taller and denser vegetation sward, an effect that may be exacerbated if they are exposed to more competitive range-shifting lowland generalists (14, 15, 25, 26). Another global change driver with major impacts on the structure and diversity of terrestrial ecosystems, including alpine vegetation, is atmospheric nitrogen deposition (1). As plant growth and biomass in alpine vegetation is often co-limited by temperature and nutrients (27), the specific effects of added nitrogen tend to be similar to those of increased temperature; increased growth, taller and denser vegetation, and intensified competition for light (18) (Figure 3.1 a). Accordingly, an experiment that combined warming and nitrogen addition treatments in alpine vegetation found that both drivers have qualitatively similar effects; increased plant growth and loss of diversity via increased competition for light (28).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Impacts of the global change drivers climate warming, atmospheric nitrogen deposition, and grazing on alpine plant communities, and the experimental design to assess interactions among multiple drivers. a) Schematic of the hypothesized impacts of these  three major drivers on alpine plant diversity, illustrating how their impacts occur through the same ecological mechanisms (productivity, which again affects standing biomass). The plus and minus signs indicate the specific relationship between the drivers and mechanisms, and the rack-wheel indicates a positive feedback between productivity and biomass. b) Illustration of how the effect of grazing on diversity is related to standing biomass, and hence can be affected by warming or nitrogen addition. Positive values on the y axis indicate an increase and negative values a decrease in diversity in response to grazing (relative to ungrazed controls), and the grey solid line indicates no effect. The non solid dark grey lines shows the expected shifting effect of intermediate (dashed) and intensive (dotted) grazing intensity on diversity as standing biomass increases (see text). The yellow arrows exemplify conditions under which intermediate or intensive grazing is expected to decrease or increase diversity. The gray square indicates conditions under which grazing can be beneficial for diversity due to release from competitive plant-plant interactions as biomass is reduced, the white background indicates conditions under which grazing can reduce diversity due to loss of facilitative interactions as biomass is reduced. Nitrogen deposition and warming (brown and pink arrows) will shift the community towards higher biomass, with implications for the effect of grazing. c) A fully factorial experiment to assess warming, nitrogen addition and grazing replicated in two sites, an alpine and a sub-alpine plant community. Warmed communities were transplanted from the alpine to the sub-alpine or from the sub-alpine to the lowland site, in fully factorial combinations with grazing and nitrogen addition treatments. The treatments are ambient (gray), warming (pink), nitrogen deposition (gray to brown (ambient temperature) or pink to brown (warmed plots), crossed with four levels of simulated grazing (yellow); none (C), intermediate (one scissor), intensive (two scissors) and natural grazing (sheep). The arrows indicate the direction of transplant. Inset shows location of the study sites in Western Norway.\n\n\n\n\n[Mechanism grazing] In contrast to warming and nutrient addition, grazing animals affect plant communities primarily through removing biomass and acting as disturbance agents through grazing and trampling, although we note that their effects on productivity are complex as they also add nutrients addition from urine and dung (Figure 3.1 a). Importantly, the effect of changes in biomass removal and disturbance on biodiversity should vary across environmental contexts, depending on the dominant biotic interactions within communities. Specifically, when environmental conditions are harsh, productivity low, and where facilitative interactions dominate, increased grazing is expected to lead to loss of facilitative interactions and may thus negatively impact diversity (white area in Figure 3.1 b). In contrast, in more productive systems, increased removal of biomass by grazers can lead to release from competitive interactions and hence increased diversity (8, 29, 30) (grey area in Figure 3.1 b). The magnitude of these effects of grazing on biodiversity thus depend both on the direction and intensity of plant-plant interactions within the vegetation (i.e., on productivity and/or environmental harshness, the x-axis in Figure 3.1 b) and on the intensity of grazing (i.e., the amount of biomass removed; dashed and dotted lines and arrows in Figure 3.1 b)(31–33).\nBased on these observations, our working hypothesis is that the effects of warming and nitrogen addition and grazing on alpine plant diversity operate through the same underlying mechanisms (Figure 3.1 a), namely the role of plant productivity and standing biomass in controlling the direction and intensity of plant-plant interactions. Specifically, a warmer climate and/or nitrogen addition should generally push plant communities towards increased standing biomass and hence increasingly competitive plant-plant interactions (i.e. red and brown arrows in Figure 3.1 b). In contrast, the effect of grazing on biodiversity should depend on the system’s position along the productivity gradient, and be negative under low productivity when facilitative interactions prevail and positive under high productivity when competitive interactions prevail (negative on the left-hand side, positive on the right-hand side, Figure 3.1 b). If these expectations are confirmed, grazing, which can be managed locally and at short time scales, provides an opportunity to empirically and experimentally test conditions under which grazing positively influences plant diversity, which again could guide management solutions for alpine grasslands exposed to climate warming and atmospheric nitrogen deposition.\n\n\n✖ Identified no targets to load.\n\n\nThe aim of this study is to assess if warmer climate, nitrogen addition, and grazing operate through the same mechanisms, namely standing biomass, on diversity in alpine and sub-alpine grasslands. We used a fully factorial field experiment replicated across two sites, an alpine and a sub-alpine grassland in Western Norway, representing different annual and growing season temperatures and consequently plant productivity (Figure S1 and S2a). The two sites reflect two different environmental contexts, i.e., different positions along the productivity gradient (x axis, Figure 3.1 b). These grasslands are grazed by domestic and natural grazers, with the extant grazing pressure decreasing with elevation (Figure S2b). Alpine and sub-alpine plant communities were exposed to a combination of warmer climate (transplant to lower elevation), increased nitrogen deposition (eight levels ranging between 0 and 150 kg N ha-1 y-1), and simulated grazing by clipping and removing biomass at two different intensities (Figure 3.1 c). Plant communities moved to lower elevation experienced an approximately 3°C increase in average growing season temperature (air: 3.09 ± 0.186 °C, ground: 3.06 ± 0.176 °C, and soil: 2.82 ± 0.142 °C (Figure S1, Table S1). We applied a large range of nitrogen levels to simulate nitrogen addition close to and well beyond the current atmospheric nitrogen deposition in the mountains in southern Norway (34) (2-3 kg N ha-1 y-1) and the critical load for change in species composition in alpine grasslands (35) (c. 5-10 kg N ha-1 y-1). Our understanding of environmentally extreme conditions is limited, and such simulations can provide a mechanistic understanding of thresholds for community change (36). We simulated grazing by clipping because our main interest was in the effect of biomass removal, however, we also had naturally grazed plots outside the fenced area to account for the difference between grazing by animals and clipping (Figure 3.1 c). After three years of global change treatments, we harvested standing biomass at peak growing season and assessed the change in vascular plant species composition and diversity. We test the hypothesis that warming, nitrogen addition, and biomass removal/cutting (simulated grazing) affect plant diversity through the same mechanism, namely standing biomass.\n\n\n\n\n1.

The non solid dark grey lines shows the expected shifting effect of intermediate (dashed) and intensive (dotted) grazing intensity on diversity as standing biomass increases (see text). The yellow arrows exemplify conditions under which intermediate or intensive grazing is expected to decrease or increase diversity.

The treatments are ambient (gray), warming (pink), nitrogen deposition (gray to brown (ambient temperature) or pink to brown (warmed plots), crossed with four levels of simulated grazing (yellow); none (C), intermediate (one scissor), intensive (two scissors) and natural grazing (sheep). The arrows indicate the direction of transplant. Inset shows location of the study sites in Western Norway.\n\n\n[Mechanism grazing] In contrast to warming and nutrient addition, grazing animals affect plant communities primarily through removing biomass and acting as disturbance agents through grazing and trampling, although we note that their effects on productivity are complex as they also add nutrients addition from urine and dung (Fig. 1a). Importantly, the effect of changes in biomass removal and disturbance on biodiversity should vary across environmental contexts, depending on the dominant biotic interactions within communities. Specifically, when environmental conditions are harsh, productivity low, and where facilitative interactions dominate, increased grazing is expected to lead to loss of facilitative interactions and may thus negatively impact diversity (white area in Fig. 1b). In contrast, in more productive systems, increased removal of biomass by grazers can lead to release from competitive interactions and hence increased diversity (Austrheim & Eriksson, 2001; Bernes et al., 2015; Niedrist et al., 2009) (grey area in Fig. 1b). The magnitude of these effects of grazing on biodiversity thus depend both on the direction and intensity of plant-plant interactions within the vegetation (i.e., on productivity and/or environmental harshness, the x-axis in Fig. 1b) and on the intensity of grazing (i.e., the amount of biomass removed; dashed and dotted lines and arrows in Fig. 1b)(Cingolani et al., 2005; Milchunas et al., 1988; Milchunas & Lauenroth, 1993). \n[Question/hypotheses] Based on these observations, we ask if the effects of warming, nitrogen addition and grazing on alpine plant diversity operate through the same underlying mechanisms, namely the role of plant productivity and standing biomass in controlling the direction and intensity of plant-plant interactions (Fig. 1a, b). Specifically, we hypothesise that a warmer climate and/or nitrogen addition should generally push plant communities towards increased standing biomass and hence increasingly competitive plant-plant interactions (i.e. brown and pink arrows in Fig. 1b). In contrast, the effect of grazing on biodiversity should depend on the system’s position along the productivity gradient, and be negative under low productivity when facilitative interactions prevail and positive under high productivity when competitive interactions prevail (negative on the left-hand side, positive on the right-hand side, Fig. 1b). If these expectations are confirmed, grazing, which can be managed locally and at short time scales, provides an opportunity to empirically and experimentally test conditions under which grazing positively influences plant diversity, which again could guide management solutions for alpine grasslands exposed to climate warming and atmospheric nitrogen deposition REFs).\nThe aim of this study is to assess if warmer climate, nitrogen addition, and grazing operate through the same mechanisms, namely standing biomass, on diversity in alpine and sub-alpine grasslands. We used a fully factorial field experiment replicated across two sites, an alpine and a sub-alpine grassland in Western Norway, representing different annual and growing season temperatures and consequently plant productivity (Figure S1 and S2a). The two sites reflect two different environmental contexts, i.e., different positions along the productivity gradient (x-axis, Fig. 1b). These grasslands are grazed by domestic and natural grazers, with the extant grazing pressure decreasing with elevation (Figure S2b). Alpine and sub-alpine plant communities were exposed to a combination of warmer climate (transplant to lower elevation), increased nitrogen deposition (eight levels ranging between 0 and 150 kg N ha-1 y-1), and simulated grazing by clipping and removing biomass at two different intensities (Fig. 1c). Plant communities moved to lower elevation experienced an approximately 3°C increase in average growing season temperature (air: 3.09 ± 0.186 °C, ground: 3.06 ± 0.176 °C, and soil: 2.82 ± 0.142 °C; Figure S1 and Table S1). We applied a large range of nitrogen levels to simulate nitrogen addition close to and well beyond the current atmospheric nitrogen deposition in the mountains in southern Norway (Aas et al., 2023) (2-3 kg N ha-1 y-1) and the critical load for change in species composition in alpine grasslands (Bobbink & Hettelingh, 2011) (c. 5-10 kg N ha-1 y-1). Our understanding of environmentally extreme conditions is limited, and such simulations can provide a mechanistic understanding of thresholds for community change (Kayler et al., 2015). We simulated grazing by clipping because our main interest was in the effect of biomass removal, however, we also had naturally grazed plots outside the fenced area to account for the difference between grazing by animals and clipping (Fig. 1c). After three years of global change treatments, we harvested standing biomass at peak growing season and assessed the change in vascular plant species composition and diversity. We test the hypothesis that warming, nitrogen addition, and biomass removal/cutting (simulated grazing) affect plant diversity through the same mechanism, namely standing biomass"

    "text": "4.0.1 Study area and experimental design\nThree semi-natural, species rich, perennial grassland sites (469, 920, and 1290 m a.s.l.) were established along an elevational gradient in Western Norway (Figure 3.1 c; 7.17°E, 60.88°N). Effectively, the experimental design has only two sites (alpine and sub-alpine), because the lowland site received only transplanted communities (warming treatment crossed with grazing and nitrogen, see below). The sites were 400 m apart in elevation, corresponding to a temperature difference of approximately 3°C in summer air, ground and soil temperature over the duration of the experiment (air temperature; alpine: 5.89 ± 0.2 °C; sub-alpine 9.12 ± 0.19 °C; lowland: 12.36 ± 0.17 °C, in situ measurement between May - September in 2019-2022; Figure S1). Annual precipitation was similar at the two lowest sites and approximately 800 mm higher at the highest site (alpine: 2089 mm; sub-alpine 1256 mm; lowland: 1292 mm; modeled climate data from the period of 2008 - 2021 by Norwegian Meteorological Institute, met.no). The sites were located on calcareous bedrock with loamy sand and grazed by sheep, goats and deer at the lowland and sub-alpine sites, and mainly sheep and reindeer at the alpine site. Annual plant productivity is similar at the lowland and sub-alpine site (1019.67 ± 80.56 g m-2 y-1, 1059.18 ± 110.2 g m-2 y-1, respectively) and about four times lower at the alpine site (256.07 ± 23.76 g m-2 y-1) (Figure S2a). Grazing pressure is 3 - 5 time higher in the sub-alpine site (148.14 ± 149.57 g m2 y-1, 1) compared to the lowland (55.27 ± 47.87 g m2 y-1) and alpine site (27.64 ± 24.69 g m2 y-1; Figure S2b). Other factors such as land-use history, vegetation type, slope and exposure were kept as constant as possible. To simulate the natural grazing regime at each site, and to avoid accumulation of biomass, the biomass within the fence was removed at the end of each field season.\n\nIn summer 2019, ten experimental blocks containing six 50 x 50 cm plots were established at each site (Figure 3.1 c) and fenced in early spring 2020. In addition, two plots per block were located outside the fence (n = 160). Each plot received a combination of warming, nitrogen addition and grazing treatments in two steps. First, each block was randomly assigned a nitrogen level, to avoid nitrogen contamination between the plots within the blocks. Second, the warming and grazing treatments were randomized within each block, with the exception of the naturally grazed plots, that were located outside the fenced area (for more details see ThreeD data paper).\nAt the end of the growing season in 2019, half of the plots of entire plant communities including roots were cut to a depth of 5 - 25 cm and transplanted to lower elevation, simulating an approximately 3.0 °C warmer growing season temperature. The control plots were not excavated, because studies from similar systems have shown that the effect of transplanting does not affect species composition (1, 2). If necessary, loose soil was carefully removed from the underside of the turf, or local soil was added to the gap or around the edges to ensure the soil surface was in plane with the surrounding vegetation.\nEach block received one of the following eight nitrogen treatments: 0, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 150 kg N ha-1 y-1, where three blocks were controls and received no nitrogen addition. Nitrogen was added to each plot using slow dissolving fertilizer pellets (YaraBela OPTI-NS 27-0-0 (4S)). We used oxidised nitrogen (NOx) formed mainly by combustion processes (3), which are the main sources of atmospheric nitrogen deposition in remote regions (i.e., away from intensive agriculture and other sources or reduced nitrogen). The nitrogen was added once at the start and once in the middle of the growing season from 2020 - 2022, except in 2020 at the lowest site, where the whole dose of fertilizer was applied at the start of the season.\nFinally, each plot was assigned one of four grazing treatments: control (inside grazing exclosure with no grazing or clipping), simulated intermediate grazing, simulated intensive grazing or natural grazing (outside grazing exclosure). We simulated grazing by manually clipping the vegetation using scissors, because our main focus was to understand the effect of biomass removal and we were less interested in the effect of fertilization and trampling by grazers. The simulated intermediate and intensive grazing plots were clipped two or four times about 2-3 cm above the ground during each growing season. The plots located outside the fence were naturally grazed by domestic and wild animals to control for the difference between grazing and clipping (i.e. selectivity of grazers and nutrients addition and trampling of grazers).\nIn 2020, the intensive grazing plots at the highest alpine site was only cut three times because it was a short growing season due to late snowmelt. An additional cut at the end of the growing season would not have yielded any biomass. In 2021 and 2022, we did not cut Carex species before the species composition was analyzed in early August (first and second cut), because they are difficult to identify without leaf tips.\n\n\n4.0.2 Data collection\nMicroclimate data was recorded continuously every 15 minutes, between July 2019 and September 2022, using Tomst TM4 loggers (4). Air, ground and soil temperature as well as soil moisture were measured at 15, 0 cm above and -6 cm below the ground in all warming and grazing treatments inside the fence and at 0, 1, 10, 100 and 150 kg N ha-1 y-1 (n = 72 loggers). At the alpine site, the block with 0.5 kg N ha-1 y-1 also received climate loggers, because this block is located further away from the rest and we wanted to make sure to catch any difference in the microclimate. The warming treatment increased air, ground and soil temperature by c. 3 °C and decreased soil moisture (Figure S1 and S8, Table S8), but nitrogen addition and grazing had no effect on the microclimate (Figure S8, Table S8).\nIn 2022, standing biomass was harvested at peak growing season in all plots that were not clipped or grazed. The biomass was harvested 2-3 cm above the ground, sorted to plant functional groups (graminoids with Cyperaceae sorted separately, forbs, legumes, shrubs, bryophytes, lichen and litter as dead unattached plant material), dried at 65 °C for 72 h and weighed. For standing biomass, the biomass of all plant functional groups were summed, except for plant litter.\nPlant species composition was recorded annually at peak growing season in all plots before the treatment in 2019 and after 3 years in 2022. We visually estimated the percentage cover of all vascular plant species to the nearest 1 % on the 25 x 25 cm inner area of each plot. The total coverage in each plot can exceed 100 %, due to layering of the vegetation. For species identification we followed the nomenclature from Lid & Lid (5).\n\nPlant height was collected at peak growing season in 2022 for the species making up 80 % of the total species coverage in a subset of plots. The data was collected from ambient and warmed plots that received 0, 5, 10, 50, or 150 kg N ha-1 y-1 of nitrogen and ambient and warmed plots that were grazed (n = 40 plots). Vegetative plant height was measured as the unstreched plant height from the ground to the highest photosynthetic tissue on the plant from up to five individuals per species and plot (n = x individual measurements). For more details on the measurements see (Vandvik PFTC6 data paper).\nEllenberg indicator values for light, temperature, nitrogen, and moisture were extracted from a database for European vascular plants (Tichy et al. 2022).\n\n\n4.0.3 Statistical analysis\nStanding biomass was estimated in all plots pre-treatment (2019) and after 3 years of treatment (2022) by multiplying vascular plant cover and vegetation height. The data was then back-transformed to weight per area (kg m-2) by using the standing biomass collected in the unclipped and ungrazed control plots in 2022 (n = 40). We first run a linear regression for all unclipped and ungrazed control plots with standing biomass as response and cover x height and the interaction of warming, log transformed nitrogen addition, and grazing as predictors. We compared the AIC’s from models with all combinations of these predictors to find the most parsimonious model. The model with the lowest AIC contained cover x height and log transformed nitrogen addition (R2 = 0.87). The regression coefficients from these models were then used to back transform the cover x height in all plots to standing biomass (kg m-2; Fig. S4). Separate models were run for 2019 and 2022.\nTo test if warming, nitrogen addition and clipping affect standing biomass, we used a fixed effects linear model with a normal error distribution. The model contained standing biomass as response and origin site of the plant community and a three-way interaction of warming, nitrogen addition and clipping as predictors. The experimental design did not allow running a mixed-effects model, because there is no replication at the plot level. Clipping was transformed to a numerical scale with 0 (control), 2 (intermediate) or 4 (intensive) cuts per growing season. The nitrogen levels we chose ranged from low to very high levels and they were unevenly distributed on a linear scale. We did not expect linear responses along this nitrogen gradient and therefore used three models that differed in the nitrogen addition treatment term, reflecting separate assumptions for the response to nitrogen addition: a) a linear term as a null model (N), b) a logarithmic term (log(N)) to account for the uneven distribution of the nitrogen levels, and c) a quadratic term (N2) allowing for a concave/convex relationship (REF). To find the most parsimonious model, we compared the AIC values of all three models and chose the one with the lowest AIC values. If the models differed in 𝚫AIC ≤ 2, we chose the simplest model. We preferred the logarithmic before the linear model, because it reflects a more realistic assumption than the null model. The most parsimonious model for standing biomass was the logarithmic model.\nExplain here that site has a very strong effect, because they are very different, so we continue with separate analysis by site? Use the same model, not including site as described above to test how global change affects standing biomass at each site separately.\n\nWe calculated the following diversity indices: species richness (n; number of species), Shannon diversity \\(H' = -\\Sigma_{i} p_{i} * ln(p_{i})\\), where \\(p_{i}\\) is the proportional abundance of species i) and species evenness \\(\\frac{H'}{log(n)}\\) using the vegan package (REF). For each of these response variables we used the same model approach as described above. For diversity the most parsimonious model was the linear model.\n\nRun different models with standing biomass, main effects and interactions and calculate the variance explained by the different components.\nTo test if warming, nitrogen addition and clipping affect plant diversity directly and/or indirectly via standing biomass, we used structural equation models (SEM). We used standing biomass and diversity at the end of the experiment. Nitrogen addition was log transformed and grazing was coded as a numeric variable representing the number of times the plot was clipped (see above).  To test the importance of site (i.e. alpine vs. sub-alpine) and because site could not be included as a random effect in the model (n = 2), we ran four separate SEMs for (i) across sites, (ii) including site as covariate in the SEM, (iii) one for the alpine, and (iv) the sub-alpine site. We ran separate SEMs for Shannon diversity, species richness, and evenness (see above). We repeated the SEMs described above for grazing (grazing and exclosure) instead of the clipping treatment). All SEMs were run using piecewiseSEM (Lefcheck, 2016).\n\n# model\nmodel &lt;- psem(\n  lm(diversity ~ biomass + warming + nitrogen + cutting, dat),\n  lm(biomass ~ warming + nitrogen + cutting, dat)\n  )\n\n# site model\nmodel &lt;- psem(\n  lm(diversity ~ biomass + warming + nitrogen + cutting + site, dat),\n  lm(biomass ~ warming + nitrogen + cutting + site, dat)\n  )\n\nTo understand the underlying mechanisms (i.e. change in abundance or colonization and extinctions) of change in biomass and/or diversity, we grouped all species occurring in the experiment into the following categories: losers (species that are present pre-treatment but not in the final year and thus go extinct), decrease (species that decrease in cover &gt; 10% between pre-treatment and the final year), stable (species that do not change in cover), increase (species that increase in cover &gt; 10% between pre-treatment and the final year), and winners (species that are not present pre-treatment but in the final year and colonize the plot). We then tested something…\n\n\n\n\n1. V. Vandvik, O. Skarpaas, K. Klanderud, R. J. Telford, A. H. Halbritter, D. E.
