## Data availability

All data underlying these analyses (including raw and processed data) are openly available on the Open Science Framework (OSF) repository[(63)](https://paperpile.com/c/KKq9O1/AhYc). 

## Code availability

All code for downloading the data from the OSF repository, data transformation, analyses and producing this manuscript are available on GitHub[(64)](https://paperpile.com/c/KKq9O1/1ay0). The whole workflow is (hopefully) fully reproducible by using a target pipeline[(65)](https://paperpile.com/c/KKq9O1/ZNBp) and a reproducible environment via renv[(66)](https://paperpile.com/c/KKq9O1/L148). Please fork the GitHub repo and reproduce the analyses and manuscript. Feedback on the efficiency, reproducibility and accuracy of the code and results are very welcome. The final version of the GitHub repository will be versioned on Zenodo.
